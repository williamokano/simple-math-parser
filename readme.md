# Math parser implementation

Back at the University, I didn't have compilers class, since I took information systems class, and at our University, it's not mandatory.

Since I lack of this knowledge, I decided to try once and create something simple.

I faced a hard problem for me to figure by myself, so I implemented a Kotlin version of this python implementation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88lmIMHhYNs

It's a youtube playlist containg how to build the lexer, the parser, and how to interpret the resulting tree.
